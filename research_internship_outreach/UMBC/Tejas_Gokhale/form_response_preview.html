"NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis" (Mildenhall et al., ECCV 2020)

This paper fundamentally changed how I think about 3D representation. Instead of explicit geometry, NeRF encodes scenes as continuous functions — elegant and powerful. I implemented it from scratch to understand every component: positional encoding for high-frequency details, hierarchical sampling for efficiency, and volume rendering for differentiable image synthesis.

What I love most: it's a perfect example of "understanding through building" — the philosophy I apply to all my projects. I don't just use frameworks; I build them to understand how they work.</textarea>

"Benchmarking Spatial Relationships in Text-to-Image Generation" (VISOR metric)

This paper directly connects to my 3D vision work. Your finding that T2I models struggle with spatial relationships (left/right/above/below) resonated deeply — spatial understanding requires geometric reasoning, which is what I've been building through NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting.

My 3DGS implementation computes explicit 3D covariance gradients — I understand how 3D structure enables 2D spatial reasoning. I believe combining differentiable 3D representations with T2I could improve spatial consistency: if models "understood" 3D, they'd get 2D spatial relationships right.

Your SPRIGHT dataset (ECCV 2024) extends this beautifully — the idea that proper spatial captions can teach models spatial reasoning is elegant and practical.</textarea>

1. "Gödel, Escher, Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter — A masterpiece connecting mathematics, art, and cognition. It shaped how I think about recursion, self-reference, and the nature of intelligence. Directly relevant to understanding how neural networks learn representations.

2. "Interstellar" (2019) — The way it visualizes higher-dimensional concepts (tesseract, wormholes) mirrors my interest in 3D/4D representations. Also: Kip Thorne's physics consulting shows how rigorous science can enable beautiful storytelling.

3. "Lex Fridman Podcast" — Conversations with researchers across AI, physics, and philosophy. I especially loved the episodes with Andrej Karpathy on neural networks and understanding fundamentals rather than just using tools.</textarea>

**Why Cognitive Vision Group:**
Your research philosophy — concept-level characterization, reasoning under incomplete information, adapting to novelty — aligns perfectly with what I'm building. My from-scratch implementations (NeRF, 3DGS, TorchiFy) demonstrate that I don't just call APIs; I understand mechanisms.

**My Relevant Projects:**
• 3D Gaussian Splatting: Differentiable rasterizer with custom backward passes for 3D covariance — explicit spatial representations
• NeRF: Pure PyTorch implementation — understanding volumetric rendering fundamentals
• TorchiFy: PyTorch-like framework — Autograd, Attention, all custom backward passes
• EENet: Early Exit Networks with 40% latency reduction — efficient inference under varying complexity

**Specific Contribution Idea:**
Your VISOR work shows T2I models struggle with spatial relationships. I'd love to explore using 3D understanding to improve spatial consistency — if T2I models could internally reason about 3D structure (via differentiable rendering), they might generate more spatially accurate images. My 3DGS backward passes could help bridge this gap.
