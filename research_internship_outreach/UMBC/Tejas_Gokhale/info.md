2. **TIPS** (WACV 2025) - Translation-invariant polyphase sampling for shift invariance
3. **SPRIGHT/Getting it Right** (ECCV 2024) - Improving spatial consistency in T2I models
4. **VISOR** (preprint) - Benchmarking spatial relationships in T2I generation
5. **TripletCLIP** (NeurIPS 2024) - Improving compositional reasoning in CLIP
6. **ALT** (WACV 2023) - Adversarial transformations for domain generalization
7. **MUTANT** (EMNLP 2020) - OOD generalization in VQA
8. **VQA-LOL** (ECCV 2020) - Logical reasoning in VQA

## Application Instructions
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT send email. Fill the Google Form instead.
- Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/... (linked on his website)
- Note: "Not looking for new Ph.D. students at this time" but accepts undergrad research

## Alignment with My Work
| My Project | His Research Area | Connection |
|------------|-------------------|------------|
| **NeRF/3DGS** | Spatial reasoning, 3D understanding | VISOR, SPRIGHT focus on spatial relationships |
| **TorchiFy** | From-scratch philosophy | He values deep systems understanding |
| **EENet** | Efficient inference | Robustness under resource constraints |
| **Differentiable rendering** | Domain generalization | Novel view synthesis = domain shift |

## Form Answers Needed
1. **Favorite Paper:** VISOR (spatial reasoning in T2I) or ALT (domain generalization)
2. **His Paper I Find Relevant:** VISOR/SPRIGHT - spatial consistency connects to 3D understanding
3. **Interests outside CS:** Philosophy, History (mentioned on website)
4. **Favorite books/movies/songs:** Need to provide 3

## Priority Level
**HIGH** - Strong alignment:
- Indian background (BITS Pilani) may appreciate IIIT Guwahati
- Spatial reasoning in T2I directly connects to my 3D work
- Values "from-scratch" understanding (my core philosophy)
- Active lab with undergrad research positions
