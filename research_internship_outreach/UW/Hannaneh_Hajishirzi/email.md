## Email

Dear Professor Hajishirzi,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I have read your "Please read before emailing me" guidelines and am writing to express my interest in joining **H2Lab** or **AI2** for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Research:**

Your commitment to open-source AI resonates deeply with my own philosophy of understanding systems from first principles. I was particularly inspired by:
- **Molmo and PixMo** — Open-weight multimodal models that rival proprietary systems while maintaining transparency
- **OLMo/Tulu** — Building fully reproducible language models is exactly the type of research I want to contribute to
- **Infini-gram mini** (EMNLP 2025 Best Paper) — Efficient n-gram search at scale is a beautiful intersection of systems and NLP

**My Relevant Experience:**

I've built AI systems **from scratch** to deeply understand how they work:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework with custom Transformer/GPT-2 implementations — forward/backward from first principles |
| [**WhisprNet**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/WhisprNet) | Multimodal ASR (audio + text) inspired by OpenAI Whisper — encoder-decoder architecture |
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable Gaussian rasterizer for 3D scene understanding |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields for photo-realistic novel view synthesis |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference (IIIT Guwahati)

**How I Can Contribute:**
My experience building Transformers from scratch (TorchiFy) and multimodal systems (WhisprNet) directly aligns with:
- OLMo development and evaluation
- Molmo multimodal reasoning
- Efficient inference research

I have also submitted the **H2Lab Questionnaire** and applied via the **AI2 Internship Portal**. I am available for **May – August 2026**.

**My resume is attached for your review.**
