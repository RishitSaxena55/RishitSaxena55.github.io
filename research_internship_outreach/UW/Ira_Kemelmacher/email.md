## Email

Dear Professor Kemelmacher-Shlizerman,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your research group for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Research Excites Me:**

Your work at the intersection of generative AI and computer graphics is precisely the direction I want to pursue. I was particularly impressed by:
- **Constrained Diffusion Implicit Models** (NeurIPS 2025) — The idea of adding constraints to diffusion models for controllable generation is fascinating
- **UltraZoom** (SIGGRAPH Asia 2025) — Generating gigapixel images pushes the boundaries of what's possible with neural rendering

Your dual role at UW and Google also offers a unique perspective bridging research and real-world applications.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I've built vision and generative systems from first principles:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable Gaussian rasterizer in PyTorch — Spherical Harmonics, 3D→2D projection, adaptive density control |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields with positional encoding & hierarchical sampling |
| [**VAE Face Generation**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/Face-Generation-Using-AutoEncoders-and-Variational-AutoEncoders) | Variational Autoencoder with reparameterization trick, latent space interpolation |
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework from scratch with custom Transformer/GPT-2 implementations |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference (IIIT Guwahati)

**How I Can Contribute:**
My experience with differentiable 3D rendering and generative models could directly contribute to:
- Diffusion-based 3D content generation
- Efficient inference for generative models
- AR/VR applications requiring real-time rendering

I am available for **May – August 2026** and would be thrilled to contribute to your team's research.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,

**Rishit Saxena**
