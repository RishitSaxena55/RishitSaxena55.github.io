Dear Professor Curless,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining the **GRAIL Lab** or **UW Reality Lab** for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Research:**

Your work combining neural rendering with generative models is exactly the direction I want to explore. I was particularly inspired by:
- **ExtraNeRF** (CVPR 2024) — Using diffusion models for visibility-aware view extrapolation is a brilliant solution to NeRF's limited camera range problem
- **Total Selfie** (CVPR 2024) — Generating full-body reconstructions from limited views demonstrates the power of combining graphics priors with learning

The combination of classical graphics knowledge with modern deep learning in your lab is precisely the approach I find most compelling.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I've built neural rendering systems **from scratch**:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields with positional encoding & hierarchical sampling — photo-realistic novel view synthesis |
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable Gaussian rasterizer in PyTorch — Spherical Harmonics, 3D→2D projection, adaptive density control |
| [**VAE Face Generation**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/Face-Generation-Using-AutoEncoders-and-Variational-AutoEncoders) | Generative model with latent space interpolation (diffusion foundations) |
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework from scratch with custom Transformer implementations |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference (IIIT Guwahati)

**How I Can Contribute:**
My hands-on experience implementing NeRF and 3DGS from first principles means I deeply understand:
- Volume rendering and differentiable rasterization
- Positional encoding and view-dependent effects
- How to integrate generative models with 3D representations

I would be excited to apply these skills to projects like ExtraNeRF or avatar generation.

I am available for **May – August 2026** and would be thrilled to contribute to GRAIL's research.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,
