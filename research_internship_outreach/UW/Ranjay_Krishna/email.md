Dear Professor Krishna,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your **Priority Research Team at AI2** or **RAIVN Lab** for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Lab:**
I am deeply inspired by your mission to democratize multimodal AI. **[Molmo](https://molmo.allenai.org/)** is a pivotal step for the open-source community—proving that high-quality, open-weight models can rival proprietary giants like GPT-4V. I am also fascinated by your work on **Visual Program Distillation**, particularly how it bridges the gap between neural flexibility and symbolic reasoning.

**How I Can Contribute:**
My research focuses on building efficient, differentiable vision systems from first principles. I believe my background could help integrate 3D spatial awareness into future iterations of multimodal models like Molmo.

**My Core Projects:**
*   **[3D Gaussian Splatting (From Scratch)](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch)**
    *   *Why it matters:* I didn't just use a library; I built the differentiable rasterizer, Spherical Harmonics projection, and adaptive density control myself in PyTorch. I understand the low-level gradients of 3D rendering.
*   **[TorchiFy](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1)** (Deep Learning Framework)
    *   *Why it matters:* Engineered a custom autograd engine and Transformer (GPT-2) implementation. I have a deep grasp of how foundation models handle computation graphs.
*   **[NeRF](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-)** & **[WhisprNet](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/WhisprNet)**
    *   Implemented Neural Radiance Fields and a multimodal ASR system to explore the limits of neural representation and audio-text alignment.

**Current Research:**
I am currently working on **Early Exit Networks** at IIIT Guwahati to optimize inference latency—skills highly relevant to making large multimodal models more efficient.

I have submitted my application via the **AI2 Internship Portal**. I am available for **May – August 2026** and would be thrilled to discuss how my engineering skills in 3D vision and system optimization can support your team's ambitious goals.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,

**Rishit Saxena**
