        Subject: Research Inquiry: Integrating 3D Scenescape into Open Multimodal Models (Molmo) - Summer 2026
    </div>

    <p>Dear Professor Krishna,</p>

    <p>I am <strong>Rishit Saxena</strong>, a second-year undergraduate <strong>Computer Science and
            Engineering</strong> student at <strong>Indian Institute of
            Information Technology Guwahati</strong> (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my
        strong interest in joining your <strong>Priority Research Team at AI2</strong> or <strong>RAIVN Lab</strong> for
        Summer 2026.</p>

    <p><strong>Why Your Lab:</strong><br>
        I am deeply inspired by your mission to democratize multimodal AI. <strong><a
                href="https://molmo.allenai.org/">Molmo</a></strong> is a pivotal step for the open-source
        community—proving that high-quality, open-weight models can rival proprietary giants like GPT-4V. I am also
        fascinated by your work on <strong>Visual Program Distillation</strong>, particularly how it bridges the gap
        between neural flexibility and symbolic reasoning.</p>

    <p><strong>How I Can Contribute:</strong><br>
        My research focuses on building efficient, differentiable vision systems from first principles. I believe my
        background could help integrate 3D spatial awareness into future iterations of multimodal models like Molmo.</p>

    <p><strong>My Core Projects:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch">3D Gaussian Splatting (From
                    Scratch)</a></strong><br>
            <em>Why it matters:</em> I didn't just use a library; I built the differentiable rasterizer, Spherical
            Harmonics projection, and adaptive density control myself in PyTorch. I understand the low-level gradients
            of 3D rendering.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 8px;">
            <strong><a href="https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1">TorchiFy</a></strong> (Deep Learning
            Framework)<br>
            <em>Why it matters:</em> Engineered a custom autograd engine and Transformer (GPT-2) implementation. I have
            a deep grasp of how foundation models handle computation graphs.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top: 8px;">
            <strong><a href="https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-">NeRF</a></strong> & <strong><a
                    href="https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/WhisprNet">WhisprNet</a></strong><br>
            Implemented Neural Radiance Fields and a multimodal ASR system to explore the limits of neural
            representation and audio-text alignment.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Current Research:</strong><br>
        I am currently working on <strong>Early Exit Networks</strong> at IIIT Guwahati to optimize inference
        latency—skills highly relevant to making large multimodal models more efficient.</p>

    <p>I have submitted my application via the <strong>AI2 Internship Portal</strong>. I am available for <strong>May –
            August
            2026</strong> and would be thrilled to discuss how my engineering skills in 3D vision and system
        optimization
        can support your team's ambitious goals.</p>

    <p><strong>My resume is attached for your review.</strong></p>

    <p>Best regards,</p>
