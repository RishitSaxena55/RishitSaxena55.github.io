Dear Professor Seitz,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your research group at the **UW Reality Lab** for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Research:**

Your pioneering work on 3D reconstruction—from Photo Tourism to the UW Reality Lab—is precisely the field I want to contribute to. I was particularly inspired by:
- **Generative Powers of Ten** (CVPR 2024) — The seamless zoom across scales using generative models is a beautiful fusion of graphics and vision
- **Infinite Texture** (2024) — Text-driven diffusion for texture synthesis represents the cutting edge of neural graphics

Your dual role at UW and Google gives you a unique perspective on bridging academic research with real-world AR/VR applications.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I've built 3D vision systems **from scratch** that align directly with your research:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Built differentiable Gaussian rasterizer in PyTorch from scratch — Spherical Harmonics, 3D→2D projection, adaptive density control (Clone/Split/Prune) |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields with positional encoding & hierarchical sampling — photo-realistic novel view synthesis |
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework from scratch with custom Transformer implementations |
| [**VAE Face Generation**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/Face-Generation-Using-AutoEncoders-and-Variational-AutoEncoders) | Generative model with latent space interpolation |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference (IIIT Guwahati)

**How I Can Contribute:**
My hands-on experience implementing differentiable 3D rendering (3DGS, NeRF) from first principles means I understand the math behind:
- Spherical Harmonics and view-dependent effects
- Differentiable rasterization vs. volume rendering
- Adaptive scene representation (density control)

I would be excited to apply these skills to your work on real-time 3D reconstruction, generative textures, or AR/VR rendering.

I am available for **May – August 2026** and would be thrilled to contribute to the UW Reality Lab's research.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,
