## Email

Dear Professor Farhadi,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining **AI2** for Summer 2026.

**Why AI2 and Your Leadership:**

AI2's commitment to open-source AI research is precisely the philosophy I believe in. I was particularly inspired by:
- **OLMo** — Building fully open language models with transparent training data and evaluation is a game-changer for reproducible AI research
- **OLMoE** (Mixture-of-Experts) — Democratizing efficient LLMs for the research community

Your dual focus on **visual reasoning** and **AI for robotics** (RING project) aligns perfectly with my interests.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I've built AI systems **from scratch** to deeply understand how they work:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework from scratch with custom Transformer/GPT-2 implementations — fully transparent gradient flow |
| [**WhisprNet**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/WhisprNet) | Multimodal ASR (audio + text) inspired by OpenAI Whisper |
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable Gaussian rasterizer for 3D scene understanding |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields for photo-realistic novel view synthesis |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference (IIIT Guwahati)

**How I Can Contribute:**
My experience building from first principles (TorchiFy, 3DGS, NeRF) reflects AI2's emphasis on transparent, reproducible research. I would be excited to contribute to:
- Open model development (OLMo ecosystem)
- Visual reasoning systems
- Efficient inference for robotics

I have submitted my application via the **AI2 Internship Portal**. I am available for **May – August 2026**.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,

**Rishit Saxena**
