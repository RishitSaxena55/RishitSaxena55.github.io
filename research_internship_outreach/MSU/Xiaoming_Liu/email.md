Dear Professor Liu,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to inquire about **summer research internship opportunities** in the **MSU Computer Vision Lab** for **May–August 2026**.

**Why Your Research Excites Me:**

Your lab's work at the intersection of vision-language models, 3D perception, and biometrics directly aligns with my research interests. I am particularly inspired by:

- **"Rethinking Vision-Language Model in Face Forensics"** (CVPR 2025 Oral) — Using VLMs for interpretable face forensics is a brilliant application of multimodal AI. The oral acceptance speaks to the significance of this direction.

- **"SapiensID: Foundation for Human Recognition"** (CVPR 2025) — Building foundation models for human recognition is exactly the kind of large-scale vision research I aspire to contribute to.

- **"RICCARDO: Radar Hit Prediction for Camera-Radar 3D Detection"** (CVPR 2025) — Multi-sensor fusion for robust 3D detection connects directly to my interest in differentiable 3D representations.

- **"CHARM3R: Unseen Camera Height Robust Monocular 3D Detector"** (ICCV 2025) — Robustness to deployment variations is crucial for real-world systems.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I believe in building systems **from first principles**:

| Project | Relevance to Your Research |
|---------|---------------------------|
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Built a deep learning framework **from scratch** with custom **Transformer** implementations (Multi-Head Attention, LayerNorm). Foundational for VLM architectures like your forensics model. |
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable Gaussian rasterizer from scratch — Spherical Harmonics, 3D-to-2D projection, adaptive density control. Directly relevant to 3D perception. |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields from scratch — volume rendering, hierarchical sampling. Connects to 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving. |
| [**EENet**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/EENet) | Early Exit Networks for efficient inference — relevant to deploying vision models in resource-constrained environments. |

**Current Research:** At IIIT Guwahati, I am researching **Early Exit Networks** and **model quantization** for efficient inference.

**Availability:** Full-time research internship, **May–August 2026** (3-4 months, flexible)
