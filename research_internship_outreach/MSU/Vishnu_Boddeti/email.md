## Email Body

Dear Professor Boddeti,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India. I am writing to apply for a **summer research internship** in the **Human Analysis Lab** for **May–August 2026** (4 months).

**Required Attachments:**
1. ✅ Resume (attached)
2. ✅ Transcripts (attached)
3. ✅ Technical Challenge Solution (attached)
   - `Block_Diagonal_Matrix_Solution.pdf` — Technical write-up
   - `block_diagonal_matrix.py` — Implementation code

**Technical Challenge Summary:**

I designed a data structure storing diagonal blocks as 1D arrays, achieving:
- **Storage:** O(n²d) instead of O(n²d²) — d× more efficient
- **Multiplication:** O(n³d) instead of O(n³d³) — d²× faster
- **Inverse:** Block Gaussian elimination in O(n³d)

The key insight is that diagonal matrices are closed under addition, multiplication, and inversion.

**Why HAL:**

Your work on AI safety, robustness, and privacy-preserving AI addresses fundamental challenges I care deeply about:
- **"PolyJuice"** (NeurIPS 2025) — Red teaming synthetic image detectors
- **"InPhyRe"** (CVPR 2024) — Exposing gaps in multimodal physical reasoning

**My Background:**

| Project | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|
| [TorchiFy](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | DL framework from scratch with Transformers |
| [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable rasterizer from scratch |
| [EENet](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/EENet) | Early Exit Networks for efficient inference |
| [NeRF](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields from scratch |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization at IIIT Guwahati (CPI: 9.23/10)
