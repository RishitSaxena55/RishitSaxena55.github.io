## ⚠️ MANDATORY TECHNICAL CHALLENGE!
**He requires ALL prospective students to complete a coding challenge BEFORE he'll consider your application!**

### The Challenge:
Matrix $A$ of size $\mathbb{R}^{nd \times nd}$ where each non-overlapping $d \times d$ block $D_{ij}$ is diagonal.
- Construct an **efficient data structure** for such matrices
- Implement **matrix multiplication**
- Implement **matrix inverse**

### For Summer Interns:
- ⚠️ Apply **at least 5 months in advance**
- Preference for **longer internship periods**

### Required Email Attachments (ALL THREE MANDATORY):
1. ✅ **Resume**
2. ✅ **Transcripts**
3. ✅ **Solution** (technical write-up + code)

**⚠️ Emails missing ANY of these will NOT be considered!**

### Solution Files Created:
- `technical_challenge/block_diagonal_matrix.py` — Implementation
- `technical_challenge/Technical_WriteUp.md` — Write-up (convert to PDF)

## Fit with Your Skills
- **Strong:** Your **EENet** (efficient inference) → AI Safety/Robustness
- **Strong:** Your **TorchiFy** (from-scratch implementations) → He values fundamentals
- **Moderate:** 3D vision less directly aligned (more 2D/biometrics focused)
- **Key:** Your coding skills essential for the technical challenge!

## Application Strategy
1. **FIRST:** Complete the technical challenge (block-diagonal matrix data structure)
2. **THEN:** Send email with challenge solution attached
3. Mention AI Safety interest if genuine
