Dear Professor Zhu,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I have submitted my application via the **RPL Lab Google Form** and am writing to express my interest in contributing to your research for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Research Inspires Me:**

The RPL Lab's work on building general-purpose robot autonomy through perception and learning is exactly the intersection I want to explore:

- **OKAMI** (CoRL 2024 Oral) — Teaching humanoids manipulation from a single video demonstration is a breakthrough paradigm
- **MimicDroid** (2025) — In-context learning for humanoid manipulation from human play videos
- **DreamGen** (CoRL 2025) — Constraint-preserving data generation addresses robotics' core data bottleneck
- **FLARE** (CoRL 2025) — Implicit world modeling shows how representations learned for rendering can help agents act

**My Relevant Experience:**

| Project | Robotics-Relevant Skills |
|---------|-------------------------|
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Real-time 3D scene representation (~300K Gaussians) — useful for **visual world models** |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural scene synthesis — applicable to **sim-to-real** transfer |
| [**DMS Mini**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/dms-mini-pro) | Real-time perception with INT8 quantization (~4.5ms) — **edge robotics** |
| [**EENet**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/EENet) | Early Exit Networks for adaptive inference — **real-time robot control** |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization at IIIT Guwahati

**How I Could Contribute:** Visual world models, efficient perception for real-time control, sim-to-real via neural rendering.

I am available for **May – August 2026** (3 months, flexible on extending remotely).

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,

**Rishit Saxena**
