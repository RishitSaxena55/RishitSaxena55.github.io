Dear Professor Huang,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining the **Graphics & AI Lab** for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Research Excites Me:**

Your lab's work on 3D generative models and neural scene representations is precisely what I want to dedicate my research career to. I've been closely following your recent papers:

- **RayZer** (ICCV 2025, Best Student Paper Honorable Mention) — Self-supervised large view synthesis that achieves remarkable generalization without per-scene optimization aligns with my interest in scalable 3D representations
- **Freditor** (ECCV 2024) — The frequency decomposition approach to NeRF editing is elegant, and I've been exploring similar editing directions in my own NeRF implementation
- **Real3D** (ICCV 2025) — Scaling reconstruction models with real-world images addresses the fundamental data bottleneck I've encountered
- **Escaping Plato's Cave** (CVPR 2025) — Aligning 3D and text latent spaces opens fascinating doors for multimodal 3D generation

**My Hands-On 3D Vision Experience:**

I believe the best way to understand these algorithms is to build them from scratch:

| Project | What I Implemented |
|---------|-------------------|
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable Gaussian rasterizer **from scratch** in PyTorch — Spherical Harmonics (degree 3) for view-dependent color, 3D covariance → 2D projection with Jacobians, adaptive density control (Clone/Split/Prune), scaling 50K→300K+ Gaussians on MipNeRF360 scenes |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Volume rendering with positional encoding, hierarchical sampling, view-dependent radiance — built to deeply understand the original paper |
| [**VAE Face Generation**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/Face-Generation-Using-AutoEncoders-and-Variational-AutoEncoders) | Generative latent space with smooth interpolation — foundational for 3D generative models |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and INT8 quantization for efficient inference at IIIT Guwahati

**Why I'd Be a Good Fit:**

Having built 3DGS and NeRF from first principles, I understand:
- The mathematics of differentiable rendering (projection, rasterization, volume integration)
- Scene representation trade-offs (explicit vs. implicit, points vs. functions)
- Optimization challenges (gradient flow, density control, regularization)

I'd be thrilled to contribute to projects like **RayZer** (self-supervised view synthesis) or **3D generative models** that leverage these foundations.

I am available for **May – August 2026** and am happy to discuss potential project directions.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,
