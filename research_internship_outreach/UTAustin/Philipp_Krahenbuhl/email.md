Dear Professor Krähenbühl,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my interest in joining your research group for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Research:**

Your work on scene understanding and video-language models is exactly the direction I want to explore. I was particularly inspired by:
- **Distilling Vision-Language Models on Millions of Videos** (CVPR 2024) — Scaling vision-language learning to massive video datasets is a compelling approach to building more robust visual representations

Your dual role at UT Austin and Apple gives you a unique perspective on both foundational research and real-world deployment.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I've built vision systems **from scratch**:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable Gaussian rasterizer in PyTorch — Spherical Harmonics, 3D→2D projection, scene understanding |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields for photo-realistic novel view synthesis |
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework from scratch with custom Transformer implementations |
| [**DMS Mini**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/dms-mini-pro) | Real-time perception with INT8 quantization for edge deployment |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference (IIIT Guwahati)

**How I Can Contribute:**
My experience with 3D scene representations (3DGS, NeRF) and efficient inference could contribute to:
- Video scene understanding
- Efficient vision-language models
- Real-time visual perception

I am available for **May – August 2026**.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,

**Rishit Saxena**
