Dear Professor Van Horn,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to inquire about **summer research internship opportunities** in your group for **May–August 2026**.

**Why Your Research Excites Me:**

Your work on building real-world ML systems for biodiversity and conservation represents exactly the kind of impactful AI I aspire to contribute to. I am particularly inspired by:

- **"Improved Zero-Shot Classification by Adapting VLMs with Text Descriptions"** (CVPR 2024) — Bridging pretrained VLMs to specialized domains through textual descriptions is elegant and practical. This directly connects to my interest in building adaptable vision systems.

- **"INQUIRE: Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval"** (NeurIPS 2024) — Creating benchmarks for real-world retrieval in biodiversity is crucial for advancing the field.

- **iNaturalist & Merlin Bird ID** — The scale at which your research impacts real users (millions!) is inspiring. I'm fascinated by the challenge of building AI systems that integrate human expertise with machine learning.

- **Visipedia** — The vision of large-scale fine-grained recognition for the natural world directly motivates my interest in practical computer vision.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I believe in building systems **from first principles**:

| Project | Relevance to Your Research |
|---------|---------------------------|
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Built a deep learning framework **from scratch** with custom **Transformer** implementations (Multi-Head Attention, LayerNorm, backward passes). This gives me foundational understanding of VLM architectures. |
| [**EENet**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/EENet) | Built Early Exit Networks for **efficient inference** — directly relevant to making VLMs practical for real-time species identification at scale. |
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable rasterizer from scratch — demonstrates ability to implement complex vision algorithms. |
| [**VAE Face Generation**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/Face-Generation-Using-AutoEncoders-and-Variational-AutoEncoders) | Generative models with latent space analysis — representation learning foundations. |

**Current Research:** At IIIT Guwahati, I am researching **Early Exit Networks** and **model quantization** for efficient inference. These skills in efficient ML directly connect to making AI systems like iNaturalist practical on edge devices.

**Regarding Summer 2026:** I understand you may be on leave through Spring 2026. I wanted to reach out early to inquire about potential opportunities for Summer 2026 research, whether at UMass or through remote collaboration.

**Availability:** Full-time research internship, **May–August 2026** (3-4 months, flexible)
