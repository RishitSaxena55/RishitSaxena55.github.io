Dear Professor Maji,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I saw from your group page that you have previously mentored undergraduate researchers from Indian institutes like IIT Kanpur, and I am writing to inquire about **summer research internship opportunities** in your group for **May–August 2026**.

**Why Your Research:**

Your work on vision-language models and AI for scientific discovery represents exactly the direction I want to pursue. I am particularly inspired by:

- **"DISCount"** (AAAI 2024 Best Paper) — Detector-based importance sampling for counting at scale is a brilliant approach to making visual census practical. The idea of using detection priors for efficient estimation connects to my interest in building practical CV systems.

- **"Generate, Transduct, Adapt"** (ICCV 2025) — Iterative transduction with VLMs shows how to extract maximum value from pretrained models through intelligent adaptation strategies.

- **"WildSAT"** (ICCV 2025) — Learning satellite representations from wildlife observations is a beautiful example of using weak supervision from ecological data. This kind of AI for science work is deeply meaningful.

- **"Improved Zero-Shot Classification by Adapting VLMs"** (CVPR 2024) — Bridging the gap between generic pretraining and specialized domains through text descriptions is elegant and practical.

**My Relevant Experience:**

I believe in building systems **from first principles** to truly understand them:

| Project | Relevance to Your Research |
|---------|---------------------------|
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Built a deep learning framework **from scratch** with custom **Transformer** implementations (Multi-Head Attention, LayerNorm, backward passes). This gives me foundational understanding of architectures that power VLMs like the ones you work with. |
| [**EENet**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/EENet) | Built Early Exit Networks for **efficient inference** — directly relevant to making VLMs practical at scale, similar to the efficiency focus in DISCount. |
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable rasterizer from scratch (Spherical Harmonics, adaptive density control) — demonstrates ability to implement complex vision algorithms. |
| [**VAE Face Generation**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/Face-Generation-Using-AutoEncoders-and-Variational-AutoEncoders) | Generative models with latent space analysis — representation learning foundations. |

**Current Research:** At IIIT Guwahati, I am researching **Early Exit Networks** and **model quantization** for efficient inference under the supervision of faculty. These skills in efficient ML directly connect to making AI systems practical for scientific applications.

**How I Could Contribute:**
- Implementing and adapting VLM architectures (TorchiFy experience)
- Efficient inference research (EENet, quantization)
- Strong from-scratch implementation skills

**Availability:** Full-time research internship, **May–August 2026** (3-4 months, flexible)
