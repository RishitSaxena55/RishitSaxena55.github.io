## Fit with Your Skills
- **Strong:** Your **TorchiFy** (custom Transformers) connects to VLM work
- **Strong:** Your from-scratch implementations show fundamentals he values
- **Moderate:** Your 3DGS/NeRF less directly related (he's more 2D/semantic focused)

## Application Strategy
- **Direct email** with research-specific pitch
- Mention you're from **IIIT Guwahati** (similar background to IIT students he's advised)
- Highlight **TorchiFy** (Transformer work) and **efficiency research** (EENet)
- Reference specific papers (VLM work, AAAI Best Paper)
