## Fit with Your Skills
- **Strong:** Your **NeRF** (novel view synthesis) connects to multi-view video understanding
- **Strong:** Your **TorchiFy** (custom architectures) aligns with his "Unified Expertise" direction
- **Moderate:** Your **EENet** (efficient inference) connects to practical vision systems
- **Note:** Less direct overlap with 3DGS work (he's more video/2D focused)

## Funding Sources
- NSF, NIH (National Eye Institute), NASA, UMass Amherst
- Projects: Text recognition for visually impaired, Self-taught vision systems

## Current Students
- 6 PhD students (Deep Chakraborty, Fabien Delattre, Zitian Chen, etc.)
- No current Masters students

## Application Strategy
- Highlight video understanding and representation learning
- Mention his work on "Unified Expertise" models
- Connect your TorchiFy framework to his architectural interests
