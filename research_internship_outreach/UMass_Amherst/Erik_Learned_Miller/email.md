Dear Professor Learned-Miller,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to inquire about **summer research internship opportunities** in the **Computer Vision Lab** for **May–August 2026**.

**Why Your Research:**

Your work on unified vision models and video understanding addresses fundamental challenges in building general-purpose visual AI. I am particularly inspired by:

- **"Toward Unified Expertise"** (PAMI 2026) — Learning a single model for diverse perception tasks is the direction the field is moving
- **Multi-view temporal video alignment** (WACV 2025) — Aggregating human pose across views connects to my interest in 3D scene understanding
- **Self-supervised embedding improvement** (AISTATS 2025) — Effective entropy maximization for better representations

**My Relevant Experience:**

| Project | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Built neural radiance fields from scratch — multi-view scene understanding, volume rendering, hierarchical sampling |
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Differentiable rasterizer from scratch — 3D-to-2D projection, view-dependent rendering |
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework from scratch with custom Transformer implementations — relevant to your "Unified Expertise" architectural work |
| [**EENet**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/EENet) | Early Exit Networks for efficient inference — practical vision systems |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference at IIIT Guwahati

**Availability:** Full-time research internship, **May–August 2026** (3-4 months)
