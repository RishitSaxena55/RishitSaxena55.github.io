**Subject:** Undergrad Researcher Interested in [RESEARCH_AREA] - Summer 2026 Internship

Dear Professor [LAST_NAME],

I am Rishit Saxena, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your lab as a research intern for Summer 2026.

**Why Your Lab:**
[PERSONALIZED_SECTION - Reference their specific paper or research focus]

**My Relevant Experience:**
I have been actively researching 3D computer vision and neural rendering:
- **3D Gaussian Splatting:** Built a differentiable Gaussian rasterizer from scratch in PyTorch, implementing 3D-to-2D projection, Spherical Harmonics, and adaptive density control
- **NeRF:** Implemented Neural Radiance Fields from scratch with hierarchical sampling and positional encoding
- **TorchiFy:** Developed a deep learning framework from first principles with custom Transformer implementations

I am currently a Research Intern at IIIT Guwahati, working on Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference.
