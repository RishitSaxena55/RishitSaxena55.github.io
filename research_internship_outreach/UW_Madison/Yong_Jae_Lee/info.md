# Professor Yong Jae Lee - Deep Research

## 1. Core Profile
*   **University**: University of Wisconsin - Madison
*   **Lab**: Computer Vision Group / visual-computing
*   **Website**: [pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/)
*   **Focus Areas**: 
    *   **Efficient Perception**: Making large models run fast (Pruning, Early Exit).
    *   **Ego-centric Vision**: Understanding video from first-person view.
    *   **Weakly Supervised Learning**: Learning with less labels.
    *   **Neuro-symbolic / Multimodal**: Connecting vision and language.

## 2. Recent Key Papers (2024-2025 Focus)
*   **[NeurIPS 2025] "Lp-3DGS: Learning to Prune 3D Gaussian Splatting"**
    *   *Relevance*: **CRITICAL MATCH**. This paper focuses on reducing the number of Gaussians (pruning) to improve speed/storage without losing quality.
    *   *Connection*: You implemented "adaptive density control (Clone/Split/**Prune**)" in your scratch implementation. You understand the trade-offs of primitive count vs. quality.
*   **[Arxiv 2024] "SafeguardGS: 3D Gaussian Primitive Pruning..."**
    *   *Relevance*: Another pruning paper. Validates the lab's deep interest in **Efficient 3D Representation**.
*   **[WACV 2025] "MFNeRF: Memory Efficient NeRF..."**
    *   *Relevance*: Focus on memory efficiency, aligning with your "Quantization" and "EENet" work.

## 3. "The Hook" (Strategy)
*   **Efficiency is the Bridge**: Do not just pitch yourself as a "3D guy". Pitch yourself as an **"Efficiency + 3D"** researcher.
*   **Combine Projects**: 
    *   Project A: **3DGS (From Scratch)** -> shows you understand the primitives and rendering pipeline deeply.
    *   Project B: **EENet (Early Exit)** -> shows you care about inference speed and compute constraints.
    *   **Synergy**: "My background involves both building 3DGS systems from first principles and designing efficient architectures (EENets), which perfectly aligns with your lab's direction in papers like Lp-3DGS."

## 4. Application Nuances
*   **Prospective Students**: Usually looks for strong implementation skills and ability to read/implement papers.
*   **Tone**: Technical, competence-focused. He is a hands-on researcher.
