# Henrik I. Christensen — UCSD CRI

## Fit Level: ⚠️ B-TIER — SYSTEMS-FOCUSED, LESS NEURAL 3D

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Research Focus** | Robot Systems, Autonomous Vehicles, SLAM, Multi-Robot |
| **Your Overlap** | TorchiFy (systems), GBC-Net (vision), SLAM concepts |
| **Key Gap** | He's systems/architecture-focused, not neural rendering |

---

## Why He's LESS ALIGNED:

| His Work | Your Overlap |
|----------|--------------|
| **Autonomous Vehicle Lab** | ⚠️ No direct AV experience |
| **Robot Systems Architecture** | ✅ TorchiFy (systems thinking) |
| **SLAM** | ⚠️ You understand concepts, not implementations |
| **Visual RL for Manipulation (CORL 2025)** | ⚠️ Tangential |
| **US National Robotics Roadmap** | Policy/leadership, not research |

---

## BUT He's VERY INFLUENTIAL:

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Title** | Qualcomm Chancellor's Chair, Distinguished Professor |
| **Directorships** | CRI, Cognitive Robotics Lab, AV Lab |
| **Co-founder** | Robust.AI, ROBO Global, Christensen Consulting |
| **Publications** | 400+ papers |
| **Citations** | 6,200+ (h-index 36) |

## Recent Papers (Your Pitch Angles):

| Paper | Venue | Your Connection |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Visual RL for Manipulation** | CORL 2025 | Your vision projects |
| **Probabilistic Semantic Mapping** | IROS 2024 | 3D scene understanding |
| **Object-based SLAM** | Various | 3D reconstruction concepts |
| **Multi-Robot Object SLAM** | T-RO 2017 | Distributed systems |

## Honest Assessment:

> ⚠️ **This is a B-TIER fit.** His research is systems-level robotics and autonomous vehicles. Your neural 3D work (NeRF/3DGS) doesn't directly align. However:
> - He's extremely influential in the field
> - He accepts undergrad interns
> - Your TorchiFy shows systems thinking
> - Worth applying if you want robotics systems exposure
