# Tara Javidi — UCSD

## Fit Level: ⚠️ B-TIER — THEORETICAL ML / INFO THEORY FOCUS

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Research Focus** | Active Learning, Information Theory, Stochastic Control, Wireless |
| **Your Overlap** | EENet (adaptive inference), TorchiFy |
| **Direct CV Work?** | ❌ No — she's more theoretical |

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING:

From her website:
> "Like other professors, I get a very large number of email requests... In general, **if you write to me about this I will not be able to reply** - except for a very few exceptionally excellent applicants per year."

**This means: Low response probability, but worth trying if you have time.**

## Key Research Areas:

| Area | Your Overlap |
|------|--------------|
| **Active Learning** | ⚠️ EENet = adaptive inference (tangential) |
| **Sequential Information Acquisition** | ⚠️ Weak |
| **Stochastic Control** | ❌ None |
| **Wireless Networks** | ❌ None |
| **Decentralized/Federated Learning** | ❌ None |

---

## Position & Credentials:

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Title** | Jerzy (George) Lewak Chair and Professor |
| **Dept** | ECE + Halicioglu Data Science |
| **Honors** | IEEE Fellow, NSF CAREER Award |
| **Industry** | Founding CTO of KavAI |
| **Service** | Editor-in-Chief IEEE JSAIT, TILOS AI Institute CoPI |

---

## Potential Pitch (Weak Alignment):

1. **EENet as "Active Inference"** — Instance-dependent computation paths = adaptive processing
2. **TorchiFy** — Systems-level understanding
3. **Curriculum Learning (GBC-Net)** — Sequential learning strategy

## My Honest Assessment:

| Aspect | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| **Research Fit** | ⚠️ B-TIER (Weak) |
| **Response Probability** | ❌ Low (she explicitly warns) |
| **Worth Applying?** | Maybe later, prioritize S-TIER first |

## Recommendation:

**Deprioritize this professor.** Focus on:
- Ravi Ramamoorthi (S-TIER, direct NeRF/3DGS)
- Zhijian Liu (S-TIER, EENet/quantization)
- David Kriegman (S-TIER, 3D capture)
- Hao Su (3D Deep Learning)
