# Kurt Keutzer — UC BERKELEY

## Fit Level: ⚠️ B-TIER FIT — BUT **NOT TAKING EXTERNAL UNDERGRADS!**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Role** | Professor of the Graduate School, EECS |
| **Institution** | UC Berkeley BAIR |
| **Focus** | LLM efficiency, Agentic systems, Efficient ML |
| **Your Overlap** | TorchiFy (systems), EENet (efficiency) — but not 3D vision |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NOT TAKING EXTERNAL UNDERGRADS!

From his website:
> **"unfortunately, I don't have the advising bandwidth, nor the time to handle visa details and so forth, to accommodate undergraduate summer interns from other institutions."**

**This is even more explicit than Kanazawa — he says NO and explains why.**

---

## His LEGENDARY Contributions:

| Work | Impact | Year |
|------|--------|------|
| **SqueezeNet** | First efficient CNN for edge | 2016 |
| **SqueezeDet** | Efficient object detection | 2017 |
| **Visual Transformers** | Published BEFORE ViT! | 2020 |
| **GPU-accelerated ML** | First to show potential | 2008 |

---

## His Current Focus:

- **LLM Efficiency** — not 3D vision
- **Diffusion Language Models** — not GANs/NeRF
- **Agentic Systems** — AlphaEvolve connection?

| **Bryan Catanzaro** | VP, Applied DL Research, NVIDIA |
| **Forrest Iandola** | AI Research Scientist, Meta |
| **Bichen Wu** | Co-Founder at Stealth (Visual Transformers!) |
| **Sehoon Kim** | X.ai |
| **Sheng Shen** | X.ai |

## His Entrepreneurship:

| Company | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| **DeepScale** | Acquired by Tesla |
| **Nexusflow.ai** | Acquired by NVIDIA |
| **Perplexity.ai** | Investor! |

## Your Overlap Assessment:

| Your Project | His Focus | Match? |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| TorchiFy | Efficient ML systems | ✅ Moderate |
| EENet | Efficient inference | ✅ Good |
| 3DGS | LLMs (not 3D) | ❌ No |
| NeRF | LLMs (not 3D) | ❌ No |
| AlphaEvolve | Agentic systems | ⚠️ Maybe? |

## Honest Assessment:

> ⚠️ **B-TIER FIT — AND CLOSED TO EXTERNAL UNDERGRADS**
>
> **Research Overlap**: Moderate at best. He's focused on LLM/agentic efficiency, not 3D vision. Your TorchiFy and EENet have some relevance, but not as strong as your 3D work.
>
> **Availability**: He explicitly says he can't handle visa details for external undergrad interns.
>
> **Recommendation**: **SKIP.** Focus on 3D vision professors who are:
> 1. Actually accepting students
> 2. Better research fit (Darrell, Malik, Efros)
