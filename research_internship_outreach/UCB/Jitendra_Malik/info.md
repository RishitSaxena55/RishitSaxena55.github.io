## Honest Assessment:

> 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 **LEGENDARY FIT!** He literally trained the people who created the things you're implementing:
> - Ross Girshick → R-CNN (your Faster R-CNN)
> - Jon Barron → NeRF (your NeRF)
> - Shubham Tulsiani → 3D reconstruction (your 3DGS)
>
> **This is THE professor for 3D vision.** Extremely competitive, but your work directly traces to his academic lineage.
