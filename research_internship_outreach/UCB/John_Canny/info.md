# John Canny — UC BERKELEY

## Fit Level: ⚠️ C-TIER — LEGENDARY HISTORICAL, BUT WEAK CURRENT FIT

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Award** | AAAI Classic Paper Award (Canny Edge Detector!) |
| **Role** | Paul and Stacy Jacobs Distinguished Professor |
| **Institution** | UC Berkeley BAIR, Berkeley Deep Drive |
| **Your Overlap** | Weak — his current work is HCI/Privacy/Big Data, not 3D vision |

---

## 🏆 His LEGENDARY Contribution:

### **Canny Edge Detector** (1986)
- One of the MOST FAMOUS algorithms in computer vision
- AAAI Classic Paper Award 2002
- You've probably used it in every CV project!

---

## His Current Focus (NOT 3D Vision):

| Area | Description | Your Match? |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **HCI** | Human-Computer Interaction | ❌ No |
| **Privacy** | Privacy-preserving computation | ❌ No |
| **Big Data** | BIDMach (GPU-accelerated ML) | ⚠️ Weak |
| **AI** | Teaching CS188 (Intro to AI) | ⚠️ General |

---

## His Notable Alumni:

| Student | Now At | Note |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Paul Jacobs** | Qualcomm | Founder! |
| **Dinesh Manocha** | Maryland | Famous graphics researcher |
| **Ming Lin** | Maryland | Collision detection! |
| **Daniel Seita** | USC | Robotics |

---

## Your Overlap Assessment:

| Your Project | His Current Work | Match? |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| 3DGS | HCI, Privacy | ❌ No |
| NeRF | Big Data, Privacy | ❌ No |
| TorchiFy | BIDMach (GPU ML) | ⚠️ Weak |
| Faster R-CNN | Not his focus | ❌ No |

## Honest Assessment:

> ⚠️ **C-TIER FIT — SKIP**
>
> **Historical Significance**: LEGENDARY — Canny Edge Detector is iconic.
>
> **Current Research**: NOT aligned with your work. He's focused on:
> - HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)
> - Privacy-preserving computation
> - Big Data analytics (BIDMach)
>
> **Your 3D vision projects (NeRF, 3DGS) don't match his current focus.**
>
> **Recommendation**: **SKIP.** Focus on professors doing active neural rendering research:
> - Ren Ng (NeRF advisor)
> - Alexei Efros (3DGS papers)
> - Jitendra Malik (3D vision lineage)
