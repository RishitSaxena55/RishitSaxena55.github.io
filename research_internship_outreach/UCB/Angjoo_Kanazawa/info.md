## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NOT TAKING EXTERNAL STUDENTS!

From her website:
> **"Interns: We are not taking visitors or students who are not at UC Berkeley at this time."**

**This means she's NOT accepting external interns.** However, I'm still creating materials in case:
1. Policy changes
2. You want to reach out anyway (some professors make exceptions)
3. Future reference

## Why She'd Be PERFECT (If Accepting):

| Her Project | Impact | Your Connection |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **gsplat** | Official 3DGS library! | **YOUR 3DGS!** |
| **Nerfstudio** | THE NeRF framework! | **YOUR NeRF!** |
| **pixelNeRF** | 2,274 citations | NeRF from few images |
| **Plenoxels** | 2,176 citations | Radiance fields |
| **Instruct-NeRF2NeRF** | ICCV 2023 | NeRF editing |
| **K-Planes** | CVPR 2023 | Explicit radiance fields |

## Her LEGENDARY Papers:

| Paper | Citations | Year |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **End-to-End Human Shape and Pose** | 2,474 | 2018 |
| **pixelNeRF** | 2,274 | 2021 |
| **Plenoxels** | 2,176 | 2022 |
| **Keep it SMPL** | 2,149 | 2016 |
| **PIFu** | 1,682 | 2019 |

## Her Famous Alumni:

| Student | Now At | Connection |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Matt Tancik** | Luma AI | Nerfstudio creator! |
| **Alex Yu** | OpenAI | Plenoxels, pixelNeRF |
| **Vickie Ye** | Anthropic | gsplat |
| **Aleksander Holynski** | Columbia (Prof) | 3D research |

---

## Her Requirements (for UCB students):

From her website:
> "If you're interested in NeRF research, **use nerf.studio and make two cool captures**! Then, address at least two github issues. You can also look into the **gsplat library**, and resolve issues there as well."

---

## Honest Assessment:

> ⚠️ **LEGENDARY FIT — BUT CLOSED TO EXTERNAL STUDENTS**
>
> Her research is THE MOST PERFECT match for your work:
> - She created **gsplat** — you implemented 3DGS
> - She created **Nerfstudio** — you implemented NeRF
> - She co-authored **Instruct-NeRF2NeRF**, **pixelNeRF**, **Plenoxels**
>
> **BUT she explicitly says "NOT taking visitors or students who are not at UC Berkeley."**
>
> **Recommendation**: Skip for now, or send a very polite email acknowledging her policy and asking if exceptions are ever made for candidates with strong 3DGS/NeRF implementations.
