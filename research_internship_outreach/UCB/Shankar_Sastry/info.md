# S. Shankar Sastry — UC BERKELEY

## Fit Level: ⭐⭐ C-TIER — LEGENDARY CV BOOK, BUT CURRENT FOCUS MISMATCHED

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Role** | Thomas M. Siebel Professor, NEC Distinguished Professor |
| **Former Roles** | Dean of Engineering (2007-2018), Director of CITRIS |
| **Institution** | UC Berkeley BAIR |
| **Your Overlap** | Weak — current focus is control/hybrid systems, NOT neural rendering |

---

## His FAMOUS Book (But Old!):

| Book | Year | Note |
|------|------|------|
| **"An Invitation to 3D Vision: From Images to Geometric Models"** | 2004 | Classical multi-view geometry |

**This is a classic textbook, but from 20+ years ago — NOT about NeRF/3DGS!**

---

## His Current Focus (NOT 3D Vision):

| Area | Description | Your Match? |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Control Systems** | Nonlinear control, adaptive control | ❌ No |
| **Hybrid Systems** | Computation and control | ❌ No |
| **Cyber-Physical Systems** | Embedded systems, security | ❌ No |
| **Robotics** | Control-focused robotics | ⚠️ Weak |

---

## Teaching (Current):
- **EE 290-4**: Learning Enabled Multi-Agent Systems

---

## His Famous Alumni (Now Professors!):

| Student | Now At |
|---------|--------|
| **Yi Ma** | Berkeley (BAIR!) |
| **Claire Tomlin** | Berkeley (BAIR!) |
| **Rene Vidal** | Johns Hopkins |
| **Bruno Sinopoli** | CMU |

---

## Your Overlap Assessment:

| Your Project | His Current Work | Match? |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| **3DGS** | Control systems | ❌ No |
| **NeRF** | Hybrid systems | ❌ No |
| **TorchiFy** | Embedded systems | ⚠️ Weak |
| **Faster R-CNN** | Not his focus | ❌ No |

## Honest Assessment:

> ⭐⭐ **C-TIER FIT — SKIP**
>
> **Historical Significance**: His 2004 "Invitation to 3D Vision" is a classic textbook on multi-view geometry.
>
> **Current Research**: Control systems, hybrid systems, cyber-physical systems — **NOT neural rendering**.
>
> **He hasn't published on NeRF/3DGS-style work.** His CV focus was classical (pre-deep learning).
>
> **Recommendation**: **SKIP.** Focus on professors doing active neural rendering:
> - Ren Ng (NeRF advisor)
> - Alexei Efros (3DGS papers)
> - His former student Yi Ma is still at Berkeley — but also more classical CV
