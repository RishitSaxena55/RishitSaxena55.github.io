# Ken Goldberg — UC BERKELEY

## Fit Level: ⭐⭐⭐ B-TIER — ROBOTICS/GRASPING, NOT 3D VISION

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Role** | William S. Floyd Jr. Distinguished Chair, IEOR/EECS |
| **Institution** | UC Berkeley BAIR, AUTOLab |
| **Company** | Co-Founder: Ambi Robotics, Jacobi Robotics |
| **Award** | Robot Learning Foundation President (CoRL!) |
| **Your Overlap** | Weak — robotics/grasping, not neural rendering |

---

## His FAMOUS Work:

| Project | Impact | Your Match? |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Dex-Net** | Deep Learning for Robot Grasping | ⚠️ Object detection? |
| **Ambi Robotics** | Startup, sorting/grasping | ⚠️ Robotics |
| **Robot Learning Foundation** | Organizes CoRL! | ⚠️ General ML |
| **Fog Robotics** | Cloud robotics | ⚠️ Systems |

---

## His Current Focus:

| Area | Description | Your Match? |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Robot Grasping** | Dex-Net, manipulation | ⚠️ Weak |
| **Medical Robotics** | Surgical automation | ❌ No |
| **Robot Learning** | CoRL conference | ⚠️ Moderate |
| **Art + Robotics** | Installations | ❌ No |

---

## Lab Connections:

His students overlap with Angjoo Kanazawa's KAIR lab:
- **Justin Kerr** (co-advised with Kanazawa)
- **Chung Min Kim** (co-advised with Kanazawa)

---

## Your Overlap Assessment:

| Your Project | His Focus | Match? |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **3DGS** | Robot grasping | ❌ No |
| **NeRF** | Not his focus | ❌ No |
| **Faster R-CNN** | Object detection (for grasping?) | ⚠️ Weak |
| **TorchiFy** | Systems understanding | ⚠️ Weak |

---

## Honest Assessment:

> ⭐⭐⭐ **B-TIER FIT — CONSIDER CAREFULLY**
>
> **His Work**: Famous for Dex-Net (robot grasping) and founding CoRL conference. Very influential in robotics.
>
> **Your Work**: Neural rendering (NeRF, 3DGS) — NOT his primary focus.
>
> **Potential Angle**: Your Faster R-CNN could connect to object detection for grasping, but this is a weak connection compared to your 3D vision professors.
>
> **Recommendation**: **LOWER PRIORITY** than Ren Ng, Efros, Malik, Darrell. Only consider if you want to pivot toward robotics/manipulation research.
