## ✅ EXPLICITLY WELCOMES REMOTE INTERNATIONAL INTERNS!
> **"We welcome international research interns! Remote interns are welcome!"**
> **"Students from underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply!"**

### How to Apply:
- **Email Dr. Xu directly** for further information

---

## Research Interests
- **Computer Vision for 3D Imaging** (Cryo-Electron Tomography)
- **Deep Learning for Cellular Image Analysis**
- **3D Structure Pattern Mining**
- **Unsupervised Learning** (Harmony paper at CVPR 2022)

## Note on Fit
⚠️ His research is on **biological 3D imaging (Cryo-ET)**, not the same as your 3DGS/NeRF work.

**However, transferable skills:**
- 3D volume processing
- Deep learning for 3D data
- Unsupervised representation learning

## Key Papers
| Paper | Venue | Connection |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Harmony: Unsupervised Disentangling Semantic Content** | CVPR 2022 | Unsupervised learning |
| Deep learning for Cryo-Tomography | ICCV 2021 | 3D image analysis |
| Convolutional autoencoder for 3D mining | J. Struct. Biol. | 3D representations |

## Student Placements
- PhD → Harvard Medical School, Stanford, Cornell, Princeton, Yale
- MS → PhD at Princeton, Stanford, Yale, CMU

## Why Consider
1. ✅ **Explicitly welcomes remote international interns**
2. ✅ **3D imaging focus** — some skill transfer
3. ✅ **Strong placement record**
4. ⚠️ Different domain (biology vs. graphics)
