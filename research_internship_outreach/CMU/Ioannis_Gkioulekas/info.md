# Professor: Ioannis Gkioulekas

## Basic Info
- **University:** Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
- **Institute:** Robotics Institute
- **Position:** Associate Professor
- **Lab:** Computational Imaging at CMU
- **Office:** 225 Elliot Dunlap Smith Hall
- **Admin:** Brian Hutchison

## Research Interests — EXCELLENT MATCH 🔥
- **Differentiable Rendering** (← Your 3DGS backward passes!)
- **Physics-based Rendering** (← Your from-scratch approach)
- **Computational Imaging** (← Novel sensing)
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** (← Your NeRF stratified sampling)
- **Non-line-of-sight Imaging** (seeing around corners)
- **LiDAR, SONAR, Interferometry**

## Why PERFECT Fit
Your work implementing **backward passes for Spherical Harmonics** and **3D covariance gradients** in 3DGS is EXACTLY the kind of "differentiable rendering" he studies. Your NeRF work on **Monte Carlo sampling** also aligns perfectly.
