# Professor: Srinivasa Narasimhan

## Basic Info
- **University:** Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
- **Institute:** Robotics Institute (Interim Director!)
- **Position:** U.A. and Helen Whitaker Professor of Robotics
- **Lab:** Illumination and Imaging Laboratory (ILIM)
- **Website:** https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/

## ✅ POSITIVE: Has Taken Summer Interns Before!
Past members list includes **"Dengyu Liu (Summer Intern, RIT)"** — so he DOES take summer interns.

---

## Research Interests — Strong Match
- **Computational Photography** (light transport, active illumination)
- **Smart Headlights** (autonomous driving safety)
- **3D Sensing** (Light Curtains, EpiToF sensors)
- **Physics-based Vision** (scattering, underwater imaging)
- **Non-line-of-sight Imaging**

## Awards (VERY Prestigious!)
| Year | Award |
|------|-------|
| 2022 | CVPR Best Paper Honorable Mention |
| 2021 | IV Best Paper Award |
| 2019 | CVPR Best Paper Award |
| 2013 | ICCV Marr Prize Honorable Mention |

## Key Alumni
- **Mohit Gupta** → Associate Professor, UW-Madison (another user target!)
- Adithya Pediredla → Assistant Professor, Dartmouth
- Mark Sheinin → Assistant Professor, Weizmann Institute

## Key Recent Projects
| Project | Connection to User's Work |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Smart Headlights** | Autonomous driving + efficient perception (DMS Mini) |
| **Light Curtains** | 3D sensing relates to 3DGS |
| **Thermal Imaging** | Novel sensing modalities |
| **Img2img-turbo** | Generative models for image transformation |

## Why Good Fit
1. **Senior professor** = More resources, prestige
2. **Has taken interns** = Proven path
3. **Physics-based** approach matches user's "from scratch" philosophy
4. **DMS Mini** (driver monitoring) aligns with Smart Headlights work
5. **Alumni network** includes Mohit Gupta

## Email Strategy
- Lead with **Smart Headlights** connection to DMS Mini
- Mention computational imaging / physics-based vision interest
- Show you understand the "physics" behind your 3DGS/NeRF work
