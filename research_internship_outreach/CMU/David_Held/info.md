- **Position:** Associate Professor
- **Lab:** RPAD (Robots Perceiving And Doing)
- **Email:** (via CMU directory)
- **Website:** https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dheld/

## ⚠️ SPECIFIC APPLICATION PROCESS
> **"If you are an undergrad looking to work in our lab for a summer or during the school year, please email me and also fill out this form. I will not reply to your email, but one of my PhD or Master's students will reach out if there is a good fit."**

### Steps:
1. **Email him** (he won't reply, but you need to do this)
2. **Fill out the form** (linked on his website)
3. **A PhD/MS student will reach out** if there's a match

## Research Interests — EXCELLENT MATCH!
- **Robot Manipulation** (← Your EENet efficiency work)
- **3D Gaussian Splatting** (SplatSim paper!) (← YOUR EXACT WORK!)
- **Deformable Object Manipulation** (cloth, soft objects)
- **Transparent/Specular Object Manipulation**
- **Autonomous Driving**
- **Self-supervised Learning**

## 🔥 KEY PAPER — DIRECTLY RELEVANT!
| Paper | Venue | Connection |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **SplatSim: Zero-Shot Sim2Real Transfer of RGB Manipulation Policies Using Gaussian Splatting** | ICRA 2025 | YOUR 3DGS WORK EXACTLY! |
| RoboGen: Generative Simulation | ICML 2024 | Simulation + robot learning |
| FlowBot3D: Articulation Flow | RSS 2022 | 3D manipulation |
| HACMan: Non-Prehensile Manipulation | CoRL 2023 | 6DOF manipulation |

## Collaborators
- **Deva Ramanan** (your other CMU target!)
- **Srinivasa Narasimhan** (your other CMU target!)
- **Katerina Fragkiadaki** (your other CMU target!)
- Zackory Erickson (co-advisor)

## Student Placements
