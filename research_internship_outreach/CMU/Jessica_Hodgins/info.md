## ⚠️ DIFFERENT FOCUS AREA
Her research is on **human motion simulation and character animation**, NOT neural rendering (3DGS/NeRF).

| Her Focus | Your Focus |
|-----------|------------|
| Motion capture | 3D Gaussian Splatting |
| Character animation | Neural Radiance Fields |
| Human motion generation | Differentiable rendering |
| Humanoid robotics | From-scratch implementations |

**Overlap:** Both are in **graphics/vision** broadly, but different sub-areas.

## Research Interests
- **Computer Animation** (motion synthesis, physics-based)
- **Human Motion Analysis** (motion capture, generation)
- **Humanoid Robotics** (legged locomotion)
- **Human-Robot Interaction**

## Key Work
| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Disney Research** | Founded and ran research labs |
| **Motion Capture Lab** | Built at CMU for human simulation |
| **Legged Locomotion** | PhD with Marc Raibert (Boston Dynamics founder!) |
| **Data-driven Animation** | Character motion from data |

## Courses She Teaches
- Computer Animation
- Computer Graphics
- Generating Natural Human Motion
- Legged Locomotion

## Why Consider
1. ✅ **Very senior and influential** — can refer to others
2. ✅ **Graphics background** — broadly related
3. ⚠️ **Different sub-area** — animation vs. neural rendering
4. ⚠️ **May be less active** — held admin roles

## Email Strategy
- Acknowledge her **legendary status** in graphics
- Frame overlap as **differentiable 3D representations** for animation
- Focus on graphics/3D connection broadly
- Seek **guidance** if not directly taking students
