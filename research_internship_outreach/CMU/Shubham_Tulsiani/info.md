## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING
> **"Are you accepting interns/visitors? We do not have any short-term positions at this time."**

**He explicitly states he does NOT take interns.** However, reaching out with a strong pitch might still be worthwhile given the perfect research alignment.

---

## Research Interests — PERFECT MATCH
- **3D Reconstruction from Sparse Views** (← Your 3DGS)
- **Differentiable Rendering** (← Your 3DGS/NeRF)
- **Ray-based Representations** (← Your NeRF)
- **Robot Manipulation** (← EENet for efficient inference)
- **Structure from Motion** (← Your 3DGS includes SfM)

## Key Recent Papers (2024-2025)
| Paper | Venue | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **DiffusionSfM** | CVPR 2025 | Predicting Structure and Motion via Ray Diffusion — directly related to your 3DGS SfM initialization |
| **Turbo3D** | CVPR 2025 | Ultra-fast Text-to-3D Generation — efficient 3D, connects to your efficiency work |
| **Sparse-view Pose Estimation** | NeurIPS 2024 | Generative reconstruction — sparse-view 3D like your 3DGS |
| **Track2Act** | ECCV 2024 | Point tracks for zero-shot manipulation — robot manipulation |
| **Cameras as Rays** | ICLR 2024 | Ray Diffusion for pose estimation — ray-based like NeRF |
| **SparseFusion** | CVPR 2023 | Distilling diffusion for 3D reconstruction |

## Background
- Postdoc at **FAIR with Abhinav Gupta** (your other target!)
- PhD at **UC Berkeley with Jitendra Malik** (legendary CV researcher)
- Collaborated with **Alyosha Efros** (another legend)

## Why Reach Out Anyway
1. His research is a **near-perfect** match for your 3DGS/NeRF work
2. He has a history of working with strong students
3. Policies can change; a compelling email may get noticed
4. Even if no intern slot, might recommend you elsewhere

## Email Strategy
- Acknowledge you know he's not taking interns
- Emphasize the STRONG alignment
- Show you've built 3DGS/NeRF from scratch (rare for undergrads)
- Ask if he'd consider an exception or recommend alternatives
