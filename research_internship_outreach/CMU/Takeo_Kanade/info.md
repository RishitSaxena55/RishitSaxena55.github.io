## ⚠️ NOTES OF CAUTION
1. **Extremely senior** — may not actively mentor new students
2. **Recent publications are sparse** (last major ones from 2019)
3. **No clear internship info** on website
4. **Best approach:** Respectful inquiry acknowledging his legendary status

## Research Interests — FOUNDATIONAL!
His work is the **foundation** of modern 3D vision:
- **Multi-baseline Stereo** (→ led to modern depth methods)
- **Factorization Method** (shape and motion from video)
- **Virtualized Reality** (multi-view 3D capture)
- **3D Face Alignment**
- **Pose Estimation** (ConvPose Machines paper!)

## Key Papers — Foundational to Your Work
| Paper | Venue | Connection |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Panoptic Studio** | PAMI 2019 | Multi-view 3D reconstruction |
| **Convolutional Pose Machines** | CVPR 2016 | Pose estimation foundation |
| **Programmable Automobile Headlights** | ECCV 2014 | With Narasimhan (your other target!) |
| **Multi-baseline Stereo** | Classic | Foundation of 3D sensing |

## Collaborators
- **Srinivasa Narasimhan** (your other CMU target!)
- **Martial Hebert** (your other CMU target!)
- **Yaser Sheikh** (Meta Codec Avatars)

## Student Placements (Alumni)
- **Shree Nayar** (Columbia CV legend)
- **Richard Szeliski** (Microsoft Research legend)
- **Larry Matthies** (JPL)
- Many other CV pioneers

## Why Consider
1. ✅ **Foundational work** — stereo/factorization underlies 3DGS
2. ✅ **Worked with Narasimhan** — connection
3. ⚠️ **Very senior** — may not take interns
4. ⚠️ **Lab activity unclear** — proceed respectfully

## Email Strategy
- Acknowledge his **legendary contributions**
- Connect your 3DGS to his **multi-view stereo** foundations
- Frame as **seeking guidance** rather than demanding internship
- Keep brief and respectful
