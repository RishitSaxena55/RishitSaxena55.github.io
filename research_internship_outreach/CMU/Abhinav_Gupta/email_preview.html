        <strong>Subject:</strong> Research Opportunity Inquiry: "Curious Engineer" Seeking to Scale Robot Learning —
        IIIT Guwahati Undergrad
    </div>

    <p>Dear Professor Gupta,</p>

    <p>I am <strong>Rishit Saxena</strong>, a second-year <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at <strong>Indian
            Institute of Information Technology Guwahati</strong>, India (CPI: <strong>9.23/10</strong>). I am writing
        to express my deep interest in <strong>undergraduate research opportunities</strong> in your lab.</p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Why Your Lab:</strong> Your philosophy of learning through <em>interaction</em> rather than passive
        observation ("Beyond Nouns and Verbs") fundamentally changed how I approach AI. Papers like <strong>"The Curious
            Robot"</strong> and <strong>"Supersizing Self-supervision"</strong> convinced me that building systems that
        <em>do</em> — not just <em>classify</em> — is the future. I want to be part of scaling this vision.
    </div>

    <hr class="divider">

    <p><strong>My Approach: Building from First Principles</strong></p>

    <p>Like your focus on learning from physical interaction, I believe in understanding systems from the ground up. I
        don't call APIs — I build the infrastructure.</p>

    <p><strong>Current Research:</strong> At IIIT Guwahati, I am researching <strong>Early Exit Networks</strong> and
        <strong>INT8 quantization</strong> for edge deployment — directly relevant to deploying learned policies on real
        robotic platforms.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I Offer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Systems engineering (built DL framework myself) for large-scale experiments</li>
        <li>Deep 3D vision experience (3DGS + NeRF + SfM) for Sim2Real pipelines</li>
        <li>Efficiency mindset (quantization, early exit) for real-time robotic inference</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have attached my resume and would be thrilled to contribute to your mission of scaling robot learning.</p>

    <p><strong>What I'm Seeking:</strong> I am eager to contribute to your lab's work on robot learning, self-supervised
        perception, or 3D understanding <strong>remotely starting immediately</strong>, and would also welcome the
        opportunity for an <strong>on-site position (Summer 2026)</strong> if available. I am flexible and committed to
        meaningful research contributions in any format.</p>

    <p><strong>Specific Direction I'd Love to Explore:</strong> 3DGS reconstructions are accurate but don't capture
        contact dynamics — critical for manipulation. I'd love to explore <strong>physics-aware Gaussian
            representations</strong> that encode rigidity/deformability, enabling better Sim2Real transfer for your
        robot learning pipeline.</p>

    <p>I would be happy to share code samples or discuss my implementations in more detail.</p>

    <p>Best regards,</p>
