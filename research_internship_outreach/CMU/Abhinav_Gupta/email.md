## Email Body

Dear Professor Gupta,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to express my strong interest in a **summer research internship** at your lab for **May–August 2026** (4 months).

**Why Your Lab:**
I have closely followed your work on **Scaling Robot Learning** and the **"Curious Robot"** philosophy. The shift from passive dataset learning to active, physical interaction ("Beyond Nouns and Verbs") resonates with my goal of building AI systems that truly *understand* the world, not just classify it. Your recent focus on **self-supervised learning at scale** inspires me to build more efficient, data-driven perception systems.

**My Approach: Building from First Principles**
Like your focus on fundamental physical interactions, I believe in understanding AI systems from the ground up. I don't just call APIs; I build the infrastructure.

**Relevant Projects:**

1.  **[TorchiFy](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) (Deep Learning Framework from Scratch):**
    *   Built a PyTorch-like library entirely from first principles to understand the mechanics of **self-supervised representations**.
    *   Implemented the **Autograd engine**, **Multi-Head Attention**, and **LayerNorm** manually.
    *   *Relevance:* Demonstrates the systems-level engineering capability needed for large-scale robot learning experiments.

2.  **[3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) (Differentiable Rasterizer):**
    *   Implemented the full pipeline from SfM initialization to differentiable rasterization without existing rendering libraries.
    *   Engineered the **backward pass** of 3D covariance gradients and Spherical Harmonics.
    *   *Relevance:* Highly applicable to **3D structure understanding** and efficient simulation environments for robots.

3.  **[NeRF](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) (Neural Radiance Fields):**
    *   Implemented stratified and hierarchical sampling from scratch for view synthesis.
    *   *Relevance:* Connects to your work on learning visual representations from 3D data.

**Current Research:**
I am researching **Early Exit Networks (EENet)** to enable efficient inference on resource-constrained devices, which aligns with deploying learned policies on real-world robotic hardware.

I have attached my resume and would be thrilled to contribute to your efforts in scaling robot learning.

Best regards,

**Rishit Saxena**
