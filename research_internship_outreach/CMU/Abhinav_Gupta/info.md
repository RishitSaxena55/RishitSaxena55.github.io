# Professor: Abhinav Gupta

## Basic Info
- **University:** Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
- **Institute:** The Robotics Institute
- **Email:** abhinavg@cs.cmu.edu
- **Office:** EDSH 121

## Research Interests — PERFECT MATCH for "From Scratch" User
- **Robot Learning:** Learning from physical interaction
- **Self-Supervised Learning:** Learning without labels (crucial for scaling)
- **3D Understanding:** Structure from Motion, NeRFs
- **Philosophy:** "Beyond Nouns and Verbs" — understanding physics/interaction

## Key Fit
- **STRONG:** Your **TorchiFy** (built from scratch) aligns with his "Self-Supervised Learning" focus — shows you understand the *internals*, not just APIs.
- **STRONG:** Your **NeRF/3DGS** work aligns with his "3D Understanding" interest.
- **STRONG:** Your "From Scratch" mantra fits his "Curious Robot" philosophy of learning via interaction.

## Paper Strategy for Email
- Connect **TorchiFy** to *Self-Supervised Learning* (understanding representations).
- Connect **3DGS/NeRF** to *Scaling Robot Learning* (efficient 3D perception).
- Mention **"The Curious Robot"** philosophy — you are a "curious engineer" building tools from scratch.

## Action Plan
- **Resume:** Reorder to put TorchiFy (DL internals) and NeRF/3DGS first. Highlight "Self-Supervised" and "Representation Learning" in skills.
- **Email:** Focus on "Scaling Learning" and "Building from First Principles".
