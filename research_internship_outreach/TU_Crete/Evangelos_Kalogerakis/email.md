## Email

Dear Professor Kalogerakis,

I am **Rishit Saxena**, a second-year undergraduate **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati** (IIIT Guwahati), India (CPI: 9.23/10). I am writing to inquire about **summer research internship opportunities** in your Generative AI, Vision, and Graphics Group for **May–August 2026**.

**Why Your Research:**

Your work on 3D generative AI is precisely the field I am most passionate about. I have been deeply inspired by your recent publications:

- **GEM3D** (SIGGRAPH 2024) — The medial-axis-based topology-aware approach elegantly ensures structural plausibility
- **DELTA** (ICLR 2025) — 8x faster dense 3D tracking while maintaining high resolution
- **GEOPARD** (ICCV 2025) — Predicting articulation from static geometry is fascinating
- **SOPHY** (WACV 2026) — Generating simulation-ready objects bridges generative AI to practical applications

I am aware of the ERC-funded **NEURi3D** project and would be thrilled to contribute to this research direction, even if through a shorter summer engagement.

**My Hands-On 3D Vision Experience:**

I believe in building systems **from first principles**:

| Project | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|
| [**3D Gaussian Splatting**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/gaussian-splatting-pytorch) | Built differentiable Gaussian rasterizer **from scratch** — Spherical Harmonics (degree 3), 3D→2D projection with Jacobians, adaptive density control, 50K→300K+ Gaussians |
| [**NeRF**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/NeRF-PyTorch-) | Neural Radiance Fields from scratch — volume rendering, positional encoding, hierarchical sampling |
| [**VAE Face Generation**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/Face-Generation-Using-AutoEncoders-and-Variational-AutoEncoders) | Generative latent space with smooth interpolation |
| [**TorchiFy**](https://github.com/RishitSaxena55/TorchiFy-v1) | Deep learning framework from scratch with custom Transformer implementations |

**Current Research:** Early Exit Networks and model quantization for efficient inference at IIIT Guwahati

**Availability:** I am available for a **full-time research internship from May to August 2026** (3-4 months).

**My Question:** Do you accept undergraduate summer research interns, or would participation in the NEURi3D project require enrollment in the MLDS MS program?

I would be grateful for any guidance on how I might contribute to your research.

**My resume is attached for your review.**

Best regards,
