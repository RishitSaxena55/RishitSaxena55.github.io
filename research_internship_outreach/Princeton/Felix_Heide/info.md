# Professor Felix Heide - Deep Research

## 1. Core Profile
*   **University**: Princeton University
*   **Lab**: Princeton Computational Imaging Lab
*   **Website**: [cs.princeton.edu/~fheide](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fheide/)
*   **Focus Areas**: 
    *   **Computational Imaging**: Co-designing hardware (optics/sensors) and software (algorithms) to see the invisible.
    *   **Neural Rendering**: NeRF, Neural Fields, Differentiable Rendering.
    *   **Automotive/Robotics**: Radar fields, sensing for driving.

## 2. Recent Key Papers (2024-2025 Focus)
*   **[NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight] "Neural Atlas Graphs for Dynamic Scene Decomposition and Editing"**
    *   *Relevance*: Deals with dynamic scenes and decomposition, a step beyond static 3DGS. Shows interest in *editable* representations.
*   **[SIGGRAPH 2024] "Radar Fields: Frequency-Space Neural Scene Representations..."**
    *   *Relevance*: Shows the lab is pushing "Neural Fields" into new modalities (Radar). Your "NeRF from scratch" experience is foundational here.
*   **[CVPR 2024] "Neural Spline Fields..."**
    *   *Relevance*: Another variant of neural representations.

## 3. "The Hook" (Strategy)
*   **"From Scratch" is Key**: Computational Imaging labs value people who understand the *physics* and the *low-level gradients*, not just people who run `pip install splatting`.
*   **Pitch**: "I don't just use tools; I build the differentiable rendering pipelines from scratch (3DGS, NeRF)."
*   **Angle**: You are interested in the *intersection* of Neural Rendering and Physics/Efficiency.

## 4. Application Nuances
*   **Lab Culture**: High output, top-tier venue focus (SIGGRAPH, CVPR, NeurIPS).
*   **Requirement**: Strong math + coding skills (C++/CUDA often needed for custom ops).
