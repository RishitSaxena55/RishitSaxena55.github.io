Subject: Inquiry from Researcher: Differentiable Rendering & Neural Fields (Re: Neural Atlas Graphs)

Dear Professor Heide,

I recently read your NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight paper, **"Neural Atlas Graphs for Dynamic Scene Decomposition and Editing"**, and was fascinated by how it tackles the decomposition of dynamic scenes—a critical next step for manageable neural representations.

I am an undergraduate researcher passionate about **computational imaging and neural rendering**. I have focused on building differentiable rendering pipelines from first principles, including implementing a **3D Gaussian Splatting rasterizer from scratch in PyTorch** (handling adaptive density control and spherical harmonics) and a **NeRF volume rendering engine**. My goal has been to deeply understand the gradient flow and physical priors required for synthesizing photo-realistic views.

My background also includes optimizing these representations for efficiency (via my work on Early Exit Networks), which I believe aligns well with your lab’s work on efficient and novel scene representations (like Neural Spline Fields and Radar Fields). I am writing to inquire if you are accepting research interns for Summer 2025 to work on next-generation neural rendering or computational imaging problems.

I have attached my resume and linked my portfolio below.

Best regards,
Rishit Saxena
