PROJECTS
TorchiFy-v1
Made a framework for deep learning models from scratch
•Architected a modular deep learning framework from first principles in PyTorch, implementing custom 
forward/backward passes for Transformer components (Multi-Head Attention, LayerNorm) without high-
level abstractions.
•Engineered a flexible model builder capable of constructing Decoder-only (GPT) and Encoder-Decoder 
(Whisper) architectures, focusing on transparency in gradient flow and weight initialization.
•Designed a clear, modular API mirroring standard libraries to facilitate research experimentation and 
understanding of the underlying computational graph.
3D Gaussian Splatting: Pure PyTorch Implementation
Novel View Synthesis using Differentiable Gaussian Rendering
•Engineered a fully differentiable Gaussian rasterizer from scratch in pure PyTorch, bypassing standard 
CUDA kernels to implement the full forward and backward passes for 3D scene reconstruction.
•Implemented 3D-to-2D projection math manually, handling the viewing transformation of 3D covariance 
matrices and optimizing Spherical Harmonics (SH) coefficients for view-dependent color.
•Developed an adaptive density control algorithm (Clone/Split/Prune) based on gradient thresholds to 
dynamically densify the point cloud from 50k to 300k+ Gaussians during training.
•Achieved functional scene reconstruction on NeRF Synthetic datasets, validating the correctness of the 
custom differentiable rendering pipeline and optimization logic.
AlphaEvolve
An LLM-driven Agent for Algorithmic Discovery
•This project is a hands-on exploration into the world of AI-driven scientific discovery, inspired by landmark 
papers like Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve. 
•It features a custom-built evolutionary agent that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to 
discover, optimize, and invent computer algorithms from scratch.
AI Hedge Fund Agent
An autonomous multi-agent system that mimics institutional trading teams to perform deep-dive stock 
analysis, risk assessment, and intrinsic valuation.
• Multi-Agent Architecture: A team of 8 specialized agents working sequentially and
collaboratively.
• Real-Time Data Ingestion:
• Market Data: Live price, volume, and historical data via yfinance.
• Technical Analysis: RSI, MACD, SMA, and Bollinger Bands via Alpha Vantage.

• Dual-Layer Sentiment Analysis:
• News: Global news search and sentiment scoring via Serper (Google News).
• Social: Retail trader psychology and "hype" analysis via StockTwits.
•Institutional Risk Management: Automated position sizing, Stop-Loss calculation,
and VaR (Value at Risk) assessment.
• Interactive Dashboard: A clean Streamlit UI to input capital, tickers, and view real-
time agent thought processes.
NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields
3D Scene Reconstruction from scratch using Deep Learning
•Engineered a fully differentiable rendering pipeline using multivariable calculus, optimizing scene 
representation via photometric reconstruction loss.
